#### Recommended workflow when starting a new project
- Create a new repo and make your initial commit on GitHub
- Clone it to your local machine (either terminal or PyCharm)
- Make more changes
- Commit when you finish a feature (EX: Create a Ghost class and let the ghost drift around), and it runs without bug
- Always push the commit to GitHub while you are working on it. (Backup!)

Note:
- You can edit files directly in the web interface. But if you are using both web interface and making changes locally, don't forget to pull from your own repo to make sure your local repository is updated.

##### For people who are working in groups:
- I recommend one person creating the repo and add the other person as a collaborator.(In your GitHub repository page, go to `Settings/Collaborator`) In bigger project that is managed with an online community, people collaborate with Fork/Pull requests.
- Try to NOT work on the same file from two accounts simultaneously. Otherwise, you will need to deal with [conflicts](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/addressing-merge-conflicts/resolving-a-merge-conflict-on-github).
- It's very important to use GitHub as your final reference point if each of you have a copy of your project locally. Always pull from GitHub before you start working.

Always `pull`, `commit`, then `push`.
